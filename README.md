# Driver-Violation-in-Jakarta-Polytechnic-State
In this era, technology is developing so rapidly. More and more new inventions and technological developments that already exist which have a variety of positive impacts and help overcome problems that are often experienced by humans. In this case, the use of technology is used to take action against motorists who break the rules.

# 1. Planning and Implementation
Four machine learning models were developed, each with special abilities. the capacity to identify a vehicle's type through pictures and videos, determine whether the driver is wearing a helmet, identify a vehicle's license plate and take a photo of it to identify the letters and numbers, and calculate the speed of the driver's car on the highway. This methodology can be used by security forces to evaluate violations that take place in their assigned territory. The talk starts with developing application systems and application programs.

Applications programs are demonstrated using flowchart diagrams. Flowchart diagrams in systems illustrate the connection and timing of processes.

=======> Gambar 3.1 Cara kerja model machine learning deteksi pelanggaran di Politeknik Negeri Jakarta <========

The flowchart above shows how the model determines the classification of tasks to be performed. When the dataset is entered into the model we want to model, the system starts. First, the system identifies the type of vehicle that was at the scene, then identifies the number plate of the vehicle that is crossing the road. Finally, the system evaluates data from cameras at the scene to ascertain whether any violations have occurred, such as exceeding the speed limit for all vehicles and requiring motorists to wear helmets. Each tested model is entered into the system one by one. Then, images from the scene cameras were used to test the model. In the end, the results of the analysis made by the model will be sent in the form of images or videos, depending on how well the model accepts the test object.

# 2.1 Vehicle Type Detection

======> Gambar 3.2 Diagram Alur Model deteksi Jenis Kendaraan <=======

The flowchart above shows the process of identifying vehicle types using Google Collaborate. Datasets, institutions, and photo/video input from surveillance cameras will be entered into Google Collaborate.

The callback will be requested after entering those three items. Take the time to customize the directory to ensure that it points to the dataset in question. calling back to ensure that the data to be trained in the future does not exceed 98%. Because, according to the rules of the confusion matrix game, the machine learning model has a tendency to judge the target with the wrong result if the level reaches 98%.

Next, reading and managing the dataset, which means modifying the existing dataset. The dataset is changed to divide the class (vehicle type class) that contains the image. This image is intended to be included as training and validation data. After reading and setting the dataset. Next, the machine learning model will be configured, compiled, and trained. At this point, the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture will be configured, compilation will be performed, and the model training duration will be set. At the end, the graph shows the results of training the machine learning model.

The graph shows the result of training the machine learning model after that step. To retrain a previously created model, Yolov5 will be called. enter video test model to enter vehicle type detection model analysis and remove requirements.txt to prevent unexpected errors. Lastly, yolov5 downloads the retrained video file.

# 2.2 Helmet Use Detection

=====> Gambar 3.3 Diagram Alur Model deteksi Penggunaan Helm <======

In the flowchart above, the helmet use detection diagram process is explained by two paths: Roboflow and Google Collaboratory. The second path ends when the dataset from roboflow is exported to Google Collaboratory. This continues until the trained weight is used to retrain the machine learning model to find images from various classes (helmet, no_helmet, and no helmet), which the model believes have above 40% correctness.

A. Roboflow
The dataset is currently created on the Roboflow platform. Search for the best dataset from various sources in Roboflow, then annotate the images and create datasets. The dataset will be exported to Google Collaborate using the lines of code generated by Roboflow once everything is complete.

B. Google Collaboratory
Download dependencies at Google Collaboratory, import the library to use, enter the Yolov5 repository, and select the GPU runtime. To support machine learning model requirements, download the dependencies, import the library, and enter yolov5. To increase the ability to perform object detection, enter yolov5.

After the Roboflow path has completed its work, the changed dataset must be exported. The model will be placed in the Yolov5 directory. In this directory, the model is retrained, a model analysis chart is created, and the trained weight is collected. Training weights are used to find files containing previously trained images to be trained again. when finished, train with the body weight trained. Images in a folder will be found and displayed on the screen by models that have a correct confidence level above 40%. Finished

# 2.3 License Plate Reading Detection

=====> Gambar 3.4 Diagram Alur Model deteksi Pembacaan Plat Nomor <=====

As before, license plate detection and reading uses Kaggle rather than Google Colaboratory. The dataset must be fetched before work begins, which must be integrated with the .xml file. File.xml contains information about bounding box photo coordinates for .jpg and .PNG formats. After the dataset is integrated with the previous file.xml.

Followed by using the Kaggle code editor. in the Kaggle editor code. The Imutils installation has been completed and the necessary library imports have been performed. To support the contour process that will be carried out in the Kaggle code editor, cuteils is installed. In the next step, a route call of the image to be tested is performed.

In order for a license plate detection model to read the writing on a car's license plate, the test requires many steps. Initially, the color of the target image is changed to an overall gray color. Then, the noise filtering and edge detection processes were changed.

In digital images, points where the brightness of the image changes sharply or, more formally, has discontinuities can be identified through an edge detection/edge detection process, which is used to reduce noise. Currently, the canny method is used to detect edges. The Canny method is used because it is capable of detecting far more discontinuities than other edge detection methods, such as the Sobel, Prewit, and Robert methods, all of which are less effective at detecting edges. The target image will have contours and a solid black base color after the edge detection and noise reduction processes are complete. go to the implementation part of contour/contour. Contours or contours can be used to identify contours or contours in the intended image. To find contours that can be detected properly by the system in the target image, use the canny edge detection technique. The output of this process is finding the location of the number plate in the form of a matrix.

Masking and reading of license plates is done afterwards with the help of the easyOCR library. The target image will be masked at the license plate location and designated area. The result is that the target image shows only part of the license plate, with the color around it being black. After obtaining a picture of the number plate, the system is asked to show the results by displaying a picture of the plate showing the number plate. After that, the image of the slice is given an overall gray color. Slice images are grayed out throughout to help the easyOCR library read and provide reading results. After getting the number plate reading results, the display will return to the image in question, but with the bounding box and the number plate reading results appearing in the image in question.

# 2.4  Driver speed detection

=====> Gambar 3.5 Diagram Alur Model deteksi kecepatan para pengendara <===== 

Driver speed detection is similar to detecting a driver's license plate number on Kaggle. The coding process in this section requires input such as installing the ubuntu package (libgtk2.0 â€“ dev), importing the required libraries, test videos, and cascade. However, Cascade is a video file with a bounding box. This derived file is coded.xml.

The code editor defines the speed of the vehicle object, then defines the tracking to find out the vehicle speed in the video target, and finally removes the tracking because it is not in the tracking region that has been previously determined via the cascade file. Finally, the test video includes lines of code that can be used to download the model analysis results.

After defining the speed, tracking, and deletion. The program will run, then download the output.avi file in which the output video contains the results of the analysis from the program that was run before.
